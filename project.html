    With overpopulation of deer in Western Pennsylvania nowadays, it is hard to imagine that before European immigration to Pennsylvania, there were far few deer. John, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette journalist, says “before massive people immigration, Pennsylvania was covered with sky-high foliage of 200-year-old trees blocked sunlight from reaching ground-level vegetation. There was simply scarce food resource for deer to inhabit here”. However, people’s arrival changed altered the environment and ecological system, meanwhile offering optimal habitat for deer. According to a USDA survey, the city’s four major parks are home to hundreds of deer who have over-browsed the woods and who often wander on to busy streets nearby. “Pennsylvania have one of the third most deer-related crashes, with a one in 63 chance”, says State Farm, who conducted their 16th annual deer vehicle collision study from July1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.
