           In Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke discusses substances and the general concept of substances, for example, human beings and horses, whereas Locke deems that such general concept of substances is intelligible, that is, these substances are in fact essentially unknown. I intend to firstly discuss Locke’s view on substances and then explain what Locke means by the intelligibility of substances. In the end, I would like to express my own opinion on Locke’s view.
